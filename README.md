# Predicting-Stock-Trends

- The dataset contains key financial indicators for 300 companies chosen from 11 different sectors of the S&P 500 index, from 10 years.
- Each company is described by values of 58 indicators that are derived from its financial statements.
- The dataset also contains information on 1-year change for each indicator, which can indicate a trend in the considered values.
- The task for the competition participants is to develop a predictive model able to accurately forecast stock trend movements based on the provided financial fundamental data.
- Such a model could have a vital role in algorithmic or manual trading, providing the trading signals for making decisions about whether it is a good moment to buy or sell the stock, or maybe not to trade at all.
